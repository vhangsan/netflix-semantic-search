## Overview

Currently, I am awaiting privileges for GenAI to enhance the project with AI capabilities. 

This project involves processing test data sourced from Kaggle to perform semantic search and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) analysis. 

The main tasks include:
- **Data Preprocessing:** load and prepare dataset for analysis
- **Word Embeddings:** generate vector embeddings for textual data
- **Semantic Search:** interpret context and meaning behind search queries
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN):** find nearest neighbors based on text embeddings

## Python Version

This project is developed with Python 3.11.5

## Installation

To set up, install necessary packages:
```
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install nltk
pip3 install gensim
pip3 install scikit-learn
```

## Data Source
The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle:

- **Netflix Data:** [Netflix TV Show & Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/senapatirajesh/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies?resource=download)
